## Project Overview

The **Loan Approval Prediction** project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved by a bank. This prediction is made by analyzing various factors and information provided by the applicant. The project involves assessing variables such as loan amount, tenure, CIBIL score, education, assets, and other relevant features. The primary objective is to understand the factors that influence loan approval and develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of loan approval for new applicants. Additionally, the project seeks to enhance customer service by prioritizing applicants who are more likely to have their loans approved.
